# Development process at Westpac

---

## Who am I?

* Developer at The Working Party
* Long–time Westpac collaborator
* User advocate!

---

## Things used to be bad

* Silos of development (design vs development)
* “Waterfall” approach to development
* Slow release cycles

---

## Silos?

* Teams don’t talk
* Handover, then wash hands
* Teams focusing on the wrong thing
  * Designers on design, programmers on code
  * Who’s focusing on the customer experience?

---

## Waterfall means what, exactly?

* Linear phases of development
* Documenting everything before work
* Does not respond to change (and change is good!)

---

## Strengths of Waterfall

* Strength in numbers
* Estimation (fixed timelines, dates)
* Ability to offshore work

---

## But Waterfall has some downsides…

* Change is discouraged
* Can be expensive
* Time is spent building the wrong things
  * Documentation
  * Testing things that will never launch
* Does not learn from mistakes

---

## What do we mean by Agile?

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

---

## Agile vs “Agile”

* FSD on index cards
* Difference between Agile process and scrum
* But that’s ok!
  * A new approach is required due to existing culture and outsourcing/offshoring

---

##What’s missing in our approach to Agile?

* More than just daily scrums
* Flexibility (time, costs, scope)
* Retrospectives

---

## What do we value?

* Efficiency/Laziness
* Sharing knowledge and techniques
* Our customers

---

## What is the most important thing?

* *What the customer sees*
* Anything else is just a byproduct of the development process

---

## What does the customer see?

* Front–end (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)
* Mobile applications
* Server response times

---

## What gets discarded?

* Wireframes, design files
* Functional specifications
* User Stories

---

## Only produce these things if it improves what the customer sees

---

## How can we be lazier?

* Better tools and frameworks
* Sharing and reusing
* Align our sites from the outset

---

## Tooling

* GUI & Starter Pack
* GEL
* Future things

## Small Multiskilled Teams

* Let’s work together!
